# LightBot
LightBot is an experimental Discord bot. This project aims to improve my JavaScript/NodeJS skills and make something cool !

You can add this bot to your Discord server [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=477880543858393128&permissions=1698163905&scope=bot). Allow permissions according to what you need but all features arn't guaranteed.

Please don't hesitate to report any issues with it in [issues](https://github.com/ArcLight4/lightbot/issues).

## Features
This bot contains :

- an account command set
- a music command set (WIP)
- tweakable settings
- multiple other commands to manage your server
- Customable welcome message for new members on your server

---------------------

Moreover, I'm thinking about create a website with a kind of documentation or configuration panel, but it's not necessarily for soon.

Don't hesitate to Watch or Star my Github repository to follow the progresses of my project
